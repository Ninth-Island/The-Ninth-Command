ook the dante-wreckerman sprites and put together first basic black spartan unarmed animations. There are 5
1. Running
2. Punching
3. Kicking
4. A Grab Kick Combo 
5. A Death Animation

I added the head and arms to the main body. I also finished transparenting the tilemaps and sliced them as well. There are currently:
1. City Grey
2. City Tan
3. Grassland
4. Mountain
5. Snow Mountain
6. Temple

The original unsliced images have been placed under images > environment > mothertiles
the rule tiles are under Tilemaps&Tiles > Tiles withing their respective folders

The slopes were the trickiest part, figuring out the rules. I can now make basic levels of the 6 environments, with background to accompany a few of them. 
I don't have any background images yet. The scales have been figure out.


TODO:

1. Make a jump/fall animation for the player
