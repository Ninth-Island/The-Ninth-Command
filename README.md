To do: sort out time periods and space stuff

Part 1

Far in the future, humanity is on the brink of a great exploration. Long ago, a fully habital planet had been discovered. Probes and satellites had been sent to survey the new discovery. A fully habital planet has been discovered with primitive natives. With the Earth full of overpopulation, global warming, air pollution, this new land of gold seems too good to be true. Imagine the thought, affordable real estate? No way. But it was inaccessible. Taking decades for conventional spacecraft to reach it, the new planet was simply out of reach. 

Until Musk Solutions, a subsidiary branch of SpaceX discovered a new propulsion system. Knowing what it would mean for the fate of the new Planet, Alia Forte (another chance). Fistname Musk assumed directorship of the development and secrecy of Musk solutions. With the technology to access Alia Forte, as well as space based control weaponry, a bloody race was sure to ensue. By giving exclusive and secret access to only a single party, the colonization and establishment of civilizations and trade routes would occur peacefully.

Firstname Musk met with the Secretary General of the UN to arrange exclusive rights to the new propulsion system, in exchange for certain privelages and a promise for the estimated amount of currency SpaceX would lose by waiting to sell the new technology, taken from taxation of import goods and taxes of the future citizens of Alia Forte. 

And so Musk Solutions, working together with the government and NASA, outfitted special long distance spacecraft to explore and survey the new land in more depth and detail than could be hoped for by probes. The entire plan was designed and to be carried out in the utmost secrecy. If anyone discovered the means to construct Musk Solutions' new propulsion system, a certain war would start.



And so phase 1 of the plan began. Satellites, rovers, life hutches, small teams of explorers and scientists were sent out. Alia Forte was mapped out and studied. (let someone who knows what they're talking about describe how similar and liveable it is to earth)

Larger teams were set out to beging building and colonization. Before civilians could arrive, proper living infrastructre had to be set up first. The natives previously seen by the probes were highly reclusive, avoiding the newcomers. The natives appeared to be primitive, but highly intelligent, perhaps capable of verbal communication. Opportunities to study them were limited, and with the hindsight of history, the explorers were hesitant to attempt to capture or kill any for study. 

Humanity had been preparing for the opportunity given to them for ages. When the chance came, we were ready. The progression of the colonies grew rapidly and successfully. The equipment, tools, and vehicles brought proved to be more than up to the task. The atmosphere was hospitable, the air cleaner than that of Earth, not requiring special filtration system. The water was clean and clear, the land fertile for farming. It seemed that Alia Forte was indeed its name: another chance. 

The Unified Nations of Earth set out to claim the new planet for the shared and fair use of member nations. Eventually, the general public would be allowed access to become colonists, as well as Musk Solutions distributing their new engines for third-party companies and other nations. First, a proper ground, aerial, and space based military would have to be established to defend the new colonies from being put under the control of existing nations. The goal was to create new nations, not make inter-planetary ones. 

As soon as a large enough group of colonists could declare themselves capable of independant existence and self-governance, they'd be accepted into the UN, recognized a nation of Alia Forte, and have their borders established and trade opened. In the meantime, the territories had to be given protection from non-member nations trying to expand their control.
